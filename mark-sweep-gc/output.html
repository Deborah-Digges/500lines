<h2 id="mark-sweep-garbage-collector">Mark Sweep Garbage Collector</h2>
<p>A high level implementation of the working of a mark-sweep garbage collector.</p>
<p>A model of a <em>stack based VM</em> is created where the stack holds references to all objects ever allocated. A <em>freeList</em> of memory is maintained from which all allocations are made.</p>
The parameters of the VM that can be configured are:
<ol>
<li>
The threshold for GC invocation - The minimum number of objects needed to trigger a GC.
</li>
<li> 
The heap size - The number of blocks available to the VM for allocation initially.
</li>
</ol>
<p>These parameters can be configured via the VM's constructor <em>VM(threshold, heapSize)</em>. The VM supports interfaces to push and pop objects from the stack.</p>
<p>The <em>reachable</em> objects are those which, starting from those on the stack, can be traced by following references. All unreachable objects are deemed <em>garbage</em> and are collected by the GC upon it's next invocation. Once an object is popped from the VM's stack it is unreachable and becomes garabge.</p>
<h2 id="gc-invocation">GC Invocation</h2>
The GC is invoked in one of two situations:
<ol>
<li> 
The number of objects allocated has reached the threshold for GC invocation.
</li>
<li> 
The heap is exhausted which causes the GC to be invoked in an attempt to free memory for a new allocation.
</li>
</ol>
